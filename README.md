WOD day 13- Grading from hackerearth (easy)


HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100 .
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round grade up to the next multiple of 5 .
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, 64 will be rounded to 85  but 29  will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each grade , round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer denoting n (the number of students). 
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grade, denoting student 's grade.

Constraints

Output Format

For each  of the  grades, print the rounded grade on a new line.
